## Space Invader

#### Description

I had the opportunity to recreate the famous Space Invader game during my senior year, in collaboration with a partner. This project, completed in two to three weeks, was an enriching experience, allowing us to explore both the functional and visual aspects of game development.

#### Conception

This project was carried out in a pair. I was responsible for developing the functionalities, while my partner handled the aesthetic aspects. We used the Pyxel library for the interface, enabling a smooth and visually appealing creation of the game.

#### Fonctionnalités

The application contains the following features:

- **Collision System:** Manages collisions between shots and enemies.
- **Scoring:** Point system based on the destruction of enemies.
- **Levels:** Progression through various levels of difficulty.
- **Shot Movement:** Precise control of player and enemy shots.

### Aperçu

The complete source code for the project is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/gus5900000/Spaceinvader).
