## AINAO

#### Description

This project is a prototype of an iOS application developed in Swift/SwiftUI. This application is dynamic and communicates with external APIs as well as a centralized database. It allowed for skill development in Swift and network calls. This project was completed during the Apple Foundation Extented program at Simplon in June 2024.

#### Conception

This project was carried out by a group of four people. We defined the problem based on the theme of "Accessibility," focusing on how a user can best navigate their environment. Our problem statement is: "Some people are discouraged from moving around in public spaces due to a disability or specific activity."

To address this issue, we designed an application that offers routes tailored to each situation. This application includes a map feature that allows users to search for nearby locations such as restrooms or benches. Users can also specify what they want to avoid, such as steep slopes or stairs, to receive a personalized route.

Our application also features a news tab, weather information connected via an external API, and a user profile. All of this is connected to a centralized database, enabling a collaborative system where users can report events on the map, such as roadworks, visible to all app users.

#### Fonctionnalités

The application contains the following features:

- **Map**: Allows users to create routes based on elements they wish to avoid.
- **News**: Keeps users informed about current events.
- **Weather**: Provides weather information and air quality.
- **Profile**: Allows users to view and customize their profile.
