## NetNinja Mobile App Prototype

#### Description

This project is a prototype of an iOS application developed in Swift/SwiftUI. The application is static and does not require any network calls. It served as an introduction to the Swift programming language. This project was completed during the Apple Foundation program at Simplon in April 2024.

#### Conception

This project was carried out by a group of four people. We defined the problem based on the theme "Science" and chose to focus on cybersecurity. The question posed was: "How can we raise awareness among users about the dangers of the Internet?"

To address this issue, we designed an application that allows users to stay informed, test their knowledge, and follow the latest news. We handled the complete design of the application, from the initial design with Figma to the creation of the prototype. We then established a list of priority features and divided the tasks among ourselves. Personally, I was responsible for the "News" view, as well as coordinating individual progress and consolidating the code from each team member.

#### Fonctionnalités

The application contains four features:

- **News**: This feature allows users to stay informed about the latest developments in cybersecurity.
- **Quiz**: Allows users to test and learn about cybersecurity in a fun way.
- **Documentation**: Provides information on various types of attacks such as phishing, ransomware, etc.
- **Profile**: Allows users to view and customize their profile, as well as assess their risk level through a questionnaire.
