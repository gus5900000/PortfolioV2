## Epigusto

#### Description

**Epigusto** is a 2D platformer with a retro aesthetic, developed in just 48 hours during an Epitech hackathon. The player controls a character in an endless runner, dodging obstacles, collecting items, and surviving as long as possible. As time goes on, the game speeds up, making the challenge more intense and exciting.

#### Design

The project was created during a 48-hour hackathon by a team of three developers. Due to the tight time constraint, we focused on a simple but effective concept: an automatic runner with pixel art visuals that are both accessible and visually striking.  
To add a fun twist, the entire codebase was written in Italian. We prioritized responsive controls, smooth animations, and balanced random elements. Sound design also played a key role, with all effects custom-made by the team.

#### Features

The application includes the following features:

- **Endless runner**: The character runs automatically, and the player only needs to manage jumps to avoid traps.  
- **Scoring system**: Collected coins increase the playerâ€™s score, encouraging calculated risk-taking.  
- **Various power-ups**: Hearts, crates, rabbits, turtles, and the rare Phoenix temporarily influence gameplay.  
- **Dynamic difficulty**: The game becomes faster and more complex over time.  
- **Original sound effects**: All sounds were uniquely created by the team.  
- **Source code in Italian**: A fun constraint followed throughout the codebase.  
- **Easter egg**: A hidden secret awaits the most curious players.  
- **Scoreboard**: Players can compare their performance and compete.
