## Toolbox

#### Description

I created a toolbox that allows for translating and correcting sentences, as well as managing files using a shortcut system. This project was developed using the PyQt5 framework for the graphical interface. Although I cannot enable the correction and translation features due to the costs associated with using the OpenAI API, the main functionalities are implemented.

#### Conception

The project was designed using the PyQt5 framework for the graphical interface. Technical choices were guided by the need for an intuitive and responsive user interface. Development focused on integrating the OpenAI API for translation and correction features, although these features are not currently operational due to costs.

#### Fonctionnalités

The application contains the following features:

- **Automatic Translation:** Uses the OpenAI API to translate texts from French to English.
- **Sentence Correction:** Automatically corrects sentences using the OpenAI API.
- **File Management:** Shortcut system to open, rename, delete, and modify any type of file.

### Aperçu

The complete source code for the project is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/gus5900000/DumsTools).
