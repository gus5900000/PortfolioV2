## Tweet Académie

#### Description

Tweet Académie is a microblogging web application inspired by Twitter. It allows users to post short messages, follow other members, view a news feed, reply, retweet, and use hashtags.  
The project was developed as a team to learn best practices in web development, project management, and collaborative work.

#### Conception

The application was built following the MVC (Model - View - Controller) architecture to separate business logic, presentation, and data handling.  
We used PHP for the back-end, JavaScript for dynamic front-end interactions, and TailwindCSS/Skeleton for the UI design.

Project management relied on GitHub Projects with clearly assigned roles (Tech Lead, Product Owner, etc.) and regular code reviews to ensure quality.  
The technical choices were driven by the goal of building a modern, responsive, and maintainable web app.

#### Fonctionnalités

The application includes the following features:

- **Tweet publishing**: Users can write and publish short messages (max 140 characters), with or without images.  
- **Live news feed**: Real-time display of the latest tweets with infinite scroll support.  
- **Hashtag and mention support**: Auto-complete, hashtag search, and profile linking via mentions.  
- **Social interactions**: Retweet, reply to tweets, follow/unfollow users.  
- **Private messaging**: Send and receive direct messages between users.  
- **Custom themes**: Light/dark mode switching and layout adaptation using Skeleton.  
- **Security and quality**: Use of PHP_CodeSniffer, role management, and code reviews to ensure robustness.
