## Cinéscope

#### Description

Cinéscope is a web application for comprehensive cinema management. Developed in PHP with an MVC architecture, it simplifies the administration of movies, screenings, and member subscriptions. Its intuitive interface and advanced features make it a powerful tool for cinema operators.

#### Conception

This project was completed individually as part of a web development training program. The approach is based on software development best practices, featuring a well-structured architecture:

- **Models**: Manage business logic and database interactions.
- **Views**: Responsive and accessible user interface.
- **Controllers**: Process requests and facilitate communication between models and views.

The application is designed to provide secure management with a role-based system (administrator, moderator, employee), subscription tracking, and traceability through a logging system.

#### Fonctionnalités

The application offers several essential features:

- **Movie Management**: Add, modify, and perform advanced searches for movies.
- **Session Management**: Schedule and assign rooms for each screening.
- **Subscription Management**: Track members and their viewing history.
- **Advanced Administration**: Dashboard with statistics, user management, and rights management.
- **Enhanced Security**: Secure authentication, SQL injection protection, and advanced session management.
